            <p>
                Hello there everyone, my name is anokidev.
                You can call me Anoki, I am a beginner that is
                learning how to code. Focusing on webdev, Python,
                backend, and datascience. Im not currently learning
                in a university, but I think I need a CS degree so I
                can work abroad, beyond my hometown, beyond my island.

                    I started to learn about computers. Initially,  
                    I am obsessed about retro and old operating system.
                    From an obscure OS called Microsoft Windows Embedded
                    POSReady 2009 that manages to extend the life of Windows XP,
                    to the fifth UNIX OS that is released to the public called
                    AT&T UNIX System V. Eventually in the mid-2020 I learn a
                    language that apparently is one of the worst shell language
                    for sysadmins, Batch Shell / MS-DOS Shell / CMD.exe .

                <h1>2021-2022</h1>

                <p>

                    After that, I decided to dive deeper, to the worlds of Javascript.
                    After being confused about the syntax of functions, I eventually manage
                    to make a simple 2D platformer game using built-in 2D Canvas API.

                <p>

                    Now, I am diving much deeper into a specific sector called
                    web development, while learning the world of backend. I still
                    hate React though, I prefer Svelte. I am also amazed by the JS 
                    developer to reinvent the wheel. But I think there are too much
                    web framework out there that no more framework will be produced.
