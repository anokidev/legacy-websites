            Welcome to my website, functions as a little blog-page.
            I merely post some sort of blog posts or a bunch of updates
            to my projects. My name is Anoki Youssou, also known as anokidev.
            I currently learn about programming, especially those that are related
            to web development, backend, database, sysadmins, graphics design, Linux,
            datascience, and open-source softwares.

        </p>

        <p>
            Currently Im living in Indonesia, specifically Bandung. Currently
            still sitting in a chair, inside a junior high school building. I
            love technology, especially all of those that are related to graphics
            design and programming. I currently use Nvim, still learning Python,
            Svelte, Typescript, etc.

        </p>

        <p>
            This is my new website ! Built on Svelte, Typescript, and SASS.
            Hosted on Github in a form of Github Pages.
